In this APP (Bamzon), you'll be visiting a digital storefront within the computer terminal. 
Bamzon will takes in orders from customers and depletes the stock from the store's inventory.

Here is how Bamzon works:
-Enter in the terminal: node bamzonCustomer.js . This connects user to a mySQL database that displays all the inventoried items.

-Items will be displayed in a table: Id | Product_Name | Department_Name | Price | Stock_Quantity.

-User will be prompted to enter the ID & quantity of desired item.

-Once selected the total of the item(s) with be displayed, and the inventory will be updated.
